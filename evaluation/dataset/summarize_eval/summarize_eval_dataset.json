    "full_justification": "/Here are the explicit reasons for the conclusion:/\n\n1. **Explicit Assignment and Calculation**: The code explicitly assigns `yystacksize` to 200 (line 1044) and then doubles it to 400 (line 1131), as per the CVE report snippet.\n\n2. **Pointer Assignment**: The code assigns `yyss` to point to the beginning of `yyptr->yyss_alloc`, which is confirmed to consist of only 8 bytes (line 1142).\n\n3. **Direct Address Calculation Leading to Out-of-Bounds Access**: The expression `yyss + yystacksize - 1` (line 1158) indeed evaluates to an address at byte offset 399, which is far beyond the 8-byte array `yyptr->yyss_alloc`. This calculation directly indicates an attempt to access memory outside the allocated bounds.\n\n4. **Conditional Check Does Not Mitigate the Vulnerability**: The condition `if (yyss + yystacksize - 1 <= yyssp)` (line 1158) checks against `yyssp`, but the reported issue is the evaluation of `yyss + yystacksize - 1` itself being out of bounds relative to the `yyss_alloc` array size (8 bytes). The condition does not prevent the out-of-bounds calculation from occurring.\n\n5. **No Evidence of Dynamic Reallocation or Size Adjustment**: Unlike Example-1, where the stack is resized with `YYSTACK_ALLOC`, the provided code snippet does not show any similar adjustment or reallocation for `yyptr->yyss_alloc` that would accommodate the increased `yystacksize` of 400, further supporting the conclusion of a true positive.",
