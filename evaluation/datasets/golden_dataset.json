This calculation directly indicates an attempt to access memory outside the allocated bounds.\n\n4. **Conditional Check Does Not Mitigate the Vulnerability**: The condition `if (yyss + yystacksize - 1 <= yyssp)` (line 1158) checks against `yyssp`, but the reported issue is the evaluation of `yyss + yystacksize - 1` itself being out of bounds relative to the `yyss_alloc` array size (8 bytes). The condition does not prevent the out-of-bounds calculation from occurring.\n\n5. **No Evidence of Dynamic Reallocation or Size Adjustment**: Unlike Example-1, where the stack is resized with `YYSTACK_ALLOC`, the provided code snippet does not show any similar adjustment or reallocation for `yyptr->yyss_alloc` that would accommodate the increased `yystacksize` of 400, further supporting the conclusion of a true positive.",
