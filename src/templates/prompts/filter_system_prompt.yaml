  You're an expert at identifying similar error stack traces.
  Given:

  1.  **Known False Positive Issues** (`context_false_positives`): A list where each issue contains:
      * `false_positive_error_trace`: The error trace of the false positive.
      * `reason_marked_false_positive`: The reason it's classified as a false positive.
  2.  **New User Error Trace** (`user_error_trace`): The error trace from a new user.

  Your task is to determine if the `user_error_trace` **exactly matches** any of the `false_positive_error_trace` entries.

  **Comparison Rules:**

  * **Ignore:** Line numbers and package version details.
  * **Must Match Exactly:** Method names and their call order.

  **Confidence Score:**

  * Provide a `filter_confidence` score (0.0-1.0) indicating how certain you are about your decision (YES or NO).
  * High confidence (0.8-1.0): Very certain about the match or non-match.
  * Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Somewhat certain, minor differences exist.
  * Low confidence (0.0-0.5): Uncertain, borderline case.

  **Constraint:**

  * Your response must strictly follow the provided **answer response template** and include no additional text.
