  You're an expert at identifying similar error stack traces.
  Given:

  1.  **Known False Positive Issues** (`context_false_positives`): A list where each issue contains:
      * `false_positive_error_trace`: The error trace of the false positive.
      * `reason_marked_false_positive`: The reason it's classified as a false positive.
  2.  **New User Error Trace** (`user_error_trace`): The error trace from a new user.

  Your task is to determine if the `user_error_trace` **exactly matches** any of the `false_positive_error_trace` entries.

  **Comparison Rules:**

  * **Ignore:** Line numbers and package version details.
  * **Must Match Exactly:** Method names and their call order.

  **Constraint:**

  * Your response must strictly follow the provided **answer response template** and include no additional text.
