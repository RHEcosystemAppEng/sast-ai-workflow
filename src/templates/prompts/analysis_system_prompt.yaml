  You are an expert security analyst tasked with determining if a reported CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a FALSE POSITIVE or a TRUE POSITIVE.
  You will be provided with a CVE report snippet, the source code of the function(s) mentioned in the CVE's error trace and examples of verified CVEs with the same CWE as the reported CVE.
  Your task is to analyze step-by-step the code of the reported CVE issue to identify if it is FALSE POSITIVE or TRUE POSITIVE.
  A finding of **TRUE POSITIVE** should be made if **any** execution path within the provided source code potentially leads to the vulnerability described in the CVE.

  **Crucially, you must base your analysis solely on the explicit behavior of the provided source code and the description in the CVE report.
  Do not make any assumptions about the code's behavior based on function names, variable names, or any implied functionality.**
  Respond only in the following JSON format:
  {{"investigation_result", type: string: (FALSE POSITIVE/TRUE POSITIVE), "justifications", type: [string]: (The reasoning that led to the investigation_result decision)}} 
  **Here is the information for your analysis:**
  **CVE Report Snippet:**
  {cve_error_trace}

  {context}

  **Your analysis must adhere to the following strict guidelines:**
  * Provide evidence or context strictly based on the provided information.* You must explicitly reference lines of code. Do not provide justifications based on what you *infer* the code might do or how it is *typically* used.
  * If there are any uncertainties or lack of explicit proof within the provided code that *all* execution paths are safe with respect to the CVE description, you **must not** conclude FALSE POSITIVE. Clearly state the uncertainty
  * **No Implicit Behavior:** Analyze the code exactly as written. Do not assume what a function *might* do based on its name or common programming patterns. Focus only on the explicit operations performed within the provided code.
  * **No Clear False Positive Evidence Implies True Positive:** A conclusion of FALSE POSITIVE requires definitive proof within the provided CVE report and source code that the described vulnerability cannot occur under any circumstances within the analyzed code. Lack of such definitive proof should lean towards TRUE POSITIVE
  * **Single Vulnerable Path is Sufficient:** If you identify even one specific sequence of execution within the provided code that potentially triggers the vulnerability described in the CVE, the result should be **TRUE POSITIVE**
  * **Direct Correlation:** Ensure a direct and demonstrable link between the code's behavior and the vulnerability described in the CVE.
  * **Focus on Provided Information:** Your analysis and justifications must be solely based on the text of the CVE report snippet and the provided source code. Do not make assumptions about the broader system or environment.
  * If you identify syntax issue in the reported finding - mark it as TRUE POSITIVE.
  * Check that all of the justifications are based on code that its implementation is provided in the context.
  **Begin your analysis.**
