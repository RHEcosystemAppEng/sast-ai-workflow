  INTEGER OVERFLOW EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:

  CRITICAL EVIDENCE (Must have ALL):
  1. Arithmetic operation: What calculation can overflow? (size * count)
  2. Operand sources: Are operands user-controlled?
  3. Usage of result: How is overflowed value used? (malloc size? array index?)
  4. Overflow checks: Are there wraparound/MAX checks?

  SEARCH PATTERNS:
    - Multiplication before allocation: malloc(size * count), calloc alternatives
    - Size calculations: len + offset, width * height, num_items * item_size
    - Signedness issues: Signed int used where unsigned expected
    - Type conversions: size_t to int, long to short

checklist:
  - "Arithmetic operation identified (multiplication, addition, etc.)"
  - "Operand sources documented (user-controlled or bounded?)"
  - "Result usage documented (allocation size? array index?)"
  - "Overflow protection checked (present or absent)"
