  GENERIC EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:

  CRITICAL EVIDENCE (Must have ALL):
  1. Input source: Where does untrusted/user data enter?
  2. Data flow: How does data reach the vulnerable operation?
  3. Vulnerable operation: What dangerous function/pattern is used?
  4. Validation: Are there any protective checks?

  SEARCH PATTERNS:
    - User input sources: argc/argv, fgets, scanf, recv, getenv
    - Data transformations: String operations, pointer arithmetic, type casts
    - Dangerous operations: Based on SAST finding description
    - Validation patterns: if checks, bounds tests, sanitization functions

checklist:
  - "Input source identified"
  - "Data flow traced to vulnerable point"
  - "Vulnerable operation details retrieved"
  - "Validation mechanisms documented"
