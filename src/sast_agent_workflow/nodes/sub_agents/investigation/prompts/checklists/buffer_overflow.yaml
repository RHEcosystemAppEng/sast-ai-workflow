  BUFFER OVERFLOW EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:

  CRITICAL EVIDENCE (Must have ALL):
  1. Source size: How long can input be? (user-controlled length? max size?)
  2. Destination buffer size: char buf[SIZE] or malloc(SIZE)?
  3. Copy operation: strcpy/memcpy/sprintf - with or without length param?
  4. Length validation: Is there a check BEFORE copy? (if len < SIZE)

  SEARCH PATTERNS:
    - Dangerous functions: strcpy, strcat, sprintf, gets, memcpy without bounds
    - Buffer declarations: Array sizes, malloc/calloc sizes
    - Bounds checks: if statements comparing length to buffer size

checklist:
  - "Buffer size documented (stack array or heap allocation)"
  - "Input source identified (and max possible length)"
  - "Copy operation details retrieved (bounded or unbounded?)"
  - "Validation presence confirmed (checked or unchecked?)"
