def filter_items_for_evaluation(summary_data):
    """
    This function iterates through `summary_data`, identifying items where the
    LLM response justification is a predefined fallback message. These are
    considered "failed" items. In practice, this filtering is mainly applied
    to self-hosted models, as they can have a higher incidence of such fallback
    responses (failures). Excluding these items from evaluation datasets helps
    ensure more accurate metrics.

    Args:
        summary_data: A list of tuples, where each tuple is (issue_objuct, summary_info).
              'issue' contains issue details (id, issue_type, trace).
              'summary_info' contains 'llm_response' attribute,
                which in turn has a 'justifications' attribute

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists:
            - items_for_evaluation (list): A list of entries from `summary_data`
              that did not use the fallback justification message.
            - failed_item_ids (list): A list of IDs from entries that used the
              fallback justification message.
